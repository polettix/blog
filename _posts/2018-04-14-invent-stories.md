I was always fascinated by *systems for creating stories*, like [Rory's
Story Cubes][rorys] and its emulators, or card alternatives like [Tell
Tale][telltale] and the [Inventafavole][inventafavole] (or [its second
take][inventafavole2]) among the many. Why not make something just for
fun?

## TL;DR

Enter [ordeal][ordeal] and have fun!

If you are curious about the syntax, you can read more about it [in the
tutorial page for Ordeal::Model][ordeal-tutorial].

## Code

The [code for the site][ordeal-webapp] on GitHub. You can use the shuffling
stuff though, it's available at [Ordeal::Model's GitHub
repository][ordeal-model-repo]. The module isn't released in CPAN yet,
mainly due to its liquid interface as of now.
