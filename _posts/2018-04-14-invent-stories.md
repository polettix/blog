I was always fascinated by *systems for creating stories*, like [Rory's
Story Cubes][rorys] and its emulators, the [Inventafavole][inventafavole]
(or [its second take][inventafavole2]). Why not make something just for
fun?

## TL;DR

Head to [ordeal][ordeal] and have fun!

## Some Background

More here in some time, come back!

## Code

The code for the site is still not available, mainly for lazyness. You can
use the shuffling stuff though, it's available at [Ordeal::Model's GitHub
repository][ordeal-model-repo].
