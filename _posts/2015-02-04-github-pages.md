I recently decided that I should probably write more. [GitHub Pages]
is a good place where to store what I write.

[GitHub Pages]: https://pages.github.com/

## What Is GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages] is a service provided by GitHub to host... pages. It is
a great way to add a website to a project hosted on GitHub, and also
quite simple to do by using git. The idea is that you create a
dedicated *branch* in your project repository, called `gh-pages`, and
put the website there. GitHub is then smart enough to take the contents
from that branch and expose them on the Internet at the right address.

If your nickname on GitHub is `mynick`, and the project is called
`myproject`, then:

* the project will be at `https://github.com/mynick/myproject`
* its pages will be at `http://mynick.github.io/myproject`

For example, my repository for the [Potrace] Perl bindings has:

* project repository at address
  [`https://github.com/polettix/Graphics-Potrace`](https://github.com/polettix/Graphics-Potrace)
* its associated page(s) at address
  [`http://polettix.github.io/Graphics-Potrace`](http://polettix.github.io/Graphics-Potrace)

[Potrace]: https://github.com/polettix/Graphics-Potrace

## Project or User/Association?

What written above is fine for projects hosted on GitHub. As a matter
of fact, there is also a *standardized* way to have similar pages for
a user or an organization.

There is a slight inconsistency in how the thing is handled though:

* it still relies on a GitHub project - good
* the GitHub project MUST have a specific name, e.g.
  `mynick.github.io` - still good
* the pages are hosted in the `master` branch instead of
  `gh-pages` - this is a bummer!

## Blog?

With the tools above - especially considering the pages for a user
or an association - it is easy to think about hosting a blog on GitHub.
We will assume that it is hosted as a project by itself, not the one
for the user/association above (although you can easily tweak the
instructions below to make it happen).

The basic idea is that keeping a blog's pages is too cumbersome to
be done manually. You will probably want to provide a consistent look,
with all headers, navigation, sides, footers... all the bells and
whistles.

One of the best approaches to take is to use some blog
generation system - we'll use [Jekyll] here - so that we can concentrate
on writing the stuff, and let the system do the heavy lifting to generate
the final pages. Hence, it makes sense to consider the blog from two
points of view:

* the generating system where you put your articles in
* the final generated site

[Jekyll]: http://jekyllrb.com/

This fits perfectly with GitHub: you can keep the generating system
as *the project*, and its associated GitHub Pages as the real blog that
is served on the Internet.

## Let's Start!

I set up my blog infrastructure using [Jekyll]. After installing it,
create your new blog like this:

{% highlight bash %}
jekyll new myblog
cd myblog
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'initial import'
{% endhighlight %}

Now you have your local repository for the blog. At this point, you
are ready for creating a new repository in GitHub (let's call it
`myblog` in user `mynick`) and tie them up:

{% highlight bash %}
git remote add origin git@github.com:mynick/myblog.git
git push -u origin master
{% endhighlight %}

It's time to start generating pages at this point. Depending on how
you installed [Jekyll] or whatever different, you might have to use
`bundle`, which is what we will assume here:

{% highlight bash %}
bundle exec jekyll build
{% endhighlight %}

Now the generated stuff will live inside the `_site` subdirectory. This
should be already included inside the `.gitignore` file generated by
Jekyll automatically, but in case it's a good moment for doing this.

The suggestion is that the `master` and `gh-pages` branches are really
separated from one another. Again, there might be many ways to do this,
I'm just providing you one here:

{% highlight bash %}
git checkout master
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git rm -rf .
{% endhighlight %}

At this point you should still have the `_site` directory lying around,
and this is where the real contents of your site actually are. A basic
strategy can be to just copy the contents of that directory inside the
root directory of the repository:

{% highlight bash %}
tar cf - -C _sites . | tar xvf -
git add .
git commit -m 'gh-pages initial import'
git push origin gh-pages:gh-pages
{% endhighlight %}

There you go, your blog is online!

## Routine Workflow

What's the workflow from now on? You will normally work in the `master`
branch - we set all this up for this reason, actually - and will switch
on the `gh-pages` branch only when needed.

Adding posts or pages in Jekyll is quite easy and there is plenty of
documentation. When you're done, make sure you are in the `master`
branch and that changes are committed, otherwise you will not be able
to switch to the `gh-pages` branch later on. It's OK to have files that
are not yet onboarded in GitHub though, `git` will not complain about
them.

At this point, you have to follow these steps:

{% highlight bash %}
bundle exec jekyll build
git checkout gh-pages
tar cf - -C _sites . | tar xvf -
git add .
git commit -m $(date '+blog status at %Y%m%d-%H%M%S')
git push origin gh-pages:gh-pages
git checkout master
{% endhighlight %}

The copy using `tar` is effective although not completely correct. In
particular, it will not take into consideration things that you *delete*,
because all items will be added to what is already saved and committed.
In general this should not be a problem though, because you will mostly
be adding things, will you not?
