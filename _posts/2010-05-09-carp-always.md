Yesterday I wrote an [article](dist-zilla) about [Dist::Zilla] and,
at a certain point, I had issues with a missing `Changes` file,
that triggered an error whose source was not evident:

[Dist::Zilla]: https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla

To find out the offending plugin I decided to hack
`Dist::Zilla::File::OnDisk`, turning a `die()` into a `Carp::confess()`
to see what was going wrong:

<pre>
<em style="color:red">--- src.OnDisk.pm</em>
<em style="color:green">+++ dst.OnDisk.pm</em>
@@ -28,7 +28,8 @@
 sub _read_file {
   my ($self) = @_;

   my $content = do { local $/; <$fh> };

Had I read the *title* of [Tokuhiro Matsuno](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/tokuhirom/)'s post
[Carp::Always::Color](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/tokuhirom/20100508/1273279912)
(well, I can't read Japanese, so I can't go beyond an
English title!), I would have avoided all the editing mess to just
use [Adriano Ferreira](http://search.cpan.org/~ferreira/)'s
[Carp::Always].

[Carp::Always]: https://metacpan.org/pod/Carp::Always

So, instead of editing the file, I should have find out where
`dzil` is installed in my system:

{% highlight text %}
~/dzilla/Sample-Module$ which dzil
/opt/perl/bin/dzil
{% endhighlight %}

This way, the `perl` executable can be called directly to add [Carp::Always]
in the command line:

{% highlight text %}
~/dzilla/Sample-Module$ perl -MCarp::Always /opt/perl/bin/dzil release

*Voil√†*, a perfect stack trace with the info I was after!
